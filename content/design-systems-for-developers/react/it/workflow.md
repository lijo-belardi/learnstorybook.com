How frontend tools work together has a significant impact on the ultimate value design and development teams can realize. When done well, it should be seamless to develop and reuse UI components.

This chapter showcases the five-step workflow by introducing a new component AvatarList.

![Design system workflow](/design-systems-for-developers/design-system-workflow-horizontal.jpg)

## Build

`AvatarList` is a component that displays multiple avatars. Like the other design system components, `AvatarList` started off being pasted into many projects, and that’s why it warrants inclusion in the design system. Let’s assume that the component was developed in another project and jump straight to the finished code for this demo.

![AvatarList](/design-systems-for-developers/AvatarList.jpg)

First, create a new branch where we’ll be tracking this work.

```shell
git checkout -b create-avatar-list-component
```

Download the `AvatarList` component and story to your machine and place them in the `/src/AvatarList` directory:

- [Story file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chromaui/learnstorybook-design-system/bd9a7647bfa61717c2388153955756e1591227de/src/AvatarList/AvatarList.stories.jsx)
- [Index file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chromaui/learnstorybook-design-system/bd9a7647bfa61717c2388153955756e1591227de/src/AvatarList/index.js)

<div class="aside">

💡 Storybook is set up to automatically detect files ending in `*.stories.js|jsx` and show them in the UI.

</div>

Nice! Now let’s articulate each UI state supported by `AvatarList`. At a glance, it’s clear that `AvatarList` supports some of `Avatar`’s properties like `small` and `loading`.

```jsx:title=src/AvatarList/AvatarList.stories.jsx
export const SmallSize = {
  args: {
    ...Short.args,
    size: 'small',
  },
};

export const Loading = {
  args: {
    ...Short.args,
    loading: true,
  },
};
```

![Storybook with more AvatarList stories](/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-with-avatarlist-loading-7-0.png)

Given that it’s a list, it should show many avatars. Let’s add stories that showcase what happens with numerous list items and with few list items.

```jsx:title=src/AvatarList/AvatarList.stories.jsx
export const Ellipsized = {
  args: {
    users: [
      ...Short.args.users,
      {
        id: '3',
        name: 'Zoltan Olah',
        avatarUrl: 'https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/81672',
      },
      {
        id: '4',
        name: 'Tim Hingston',
        avatarUrl: 'https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1831709',
      },
    ],
  },
};

export const BigUserCount = {
  args: {
    users: Ellipsized.args.users,
    userCount: 100,
  },
};

export const Empty = {
  args: {
    users: [],
  },
};
```

Save your progress and commit.

```shell
git commit -am "Added AvatarList and stories"
```

## Document

With the Storybook's [auto-documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/autodocs) feature, creating customizable documentation is effortless. This is beneficial for others who want to learn how to use AvatarList, as they can easily refer to the Docs entry in the Storybook UI.

![Storybook docs with minimal AvatarList info](/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-docs-minimal-avatarlist-7-0.png)

Minimum viable docs! Let’s make AvatarList a bit more human by supplying additional context on how to use it.

```jsx:title=src/AvatarList/AvatarList.jsx
/**
 * A list of Avatars, ellipsized to at most 3. Supports passing only a subset of the total user count.
 */
export function AvatarList({ loading, users, userCount, size, ...props }) {}
```

Sprinkle in some additional details about the supported props.

```jsx:title=src/AvatarList/AvatarList.jsx
AvatarList.propTypes = {
  /**
   * Are we loading avatar data from the network?
   */
  loading: PropTypes.bool,
  /**
   * A (sub)-list of the users whose avatars we have data for. Note: only 3 will be displayed.
   */
  users: PropTypes.arrayOf(
    PropTypes.shape({
      id: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      name: PropTypes.string,
      avatarUrl: PropTypes.string,
    })
  ),
  /**
   * The total number of users, if a subset is passed to `users`.
   */
  userCount: PropTypes.number,
  /**
   * AvatarList comes in four sizes. In most cases, you’ll be fine with `medium`.
   */
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(sizes)),
};
```

Easy as pie! This level of detail is sufficient for now-–we can always customize more using MDX later.

![Storybook docs with full AvatarList info](/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-docs-full-avatarlist-7-0.png)

Documentation doesn’t have to be tiresome. With automated tooling, we removed the tedium to get straight to writing.

Commit the changes and push to GitHub.

```shell
git commit -am "Improved AvatarList docs"
```

### Prepare for publishing

Before publishing our component to the design system, we must ensure it’s available once installed. Let’s add it to the design system’s `index.js` file.

```diff:title=src/index.js
import * as styles from './shared/styles';
import * as animation from './shared/animation';
import * as icons from './shared/icons';
import * as global from './shared/global';

export { styles, animation, icons, global };

export * from './Avatar';
+ export * from './AvatarList';
export * from './Badge';
export * from './Button';
export * from './Icon';
export * from './Link';
export * from './LinkWrapper';

```

#### Create a Pull Request

Let’s push our `AvatarList` branch to GitHub and create a pull request:

```shell
git push -u origin create-avatar-list-component
```

Then navigate to GitHub and open a pull request.

![PR created in PR for AvatarList](/design-systems-for-developers/github-pr-create-avatarlist.png)

## Review

At this point, `AvatarList` is a candidate for design system inclusion. Stakeholders must review the component to see if it meets expectations for functionality and appearance.

The design system’s Storybook is automatically published with each pull request to make review dead simple. Scroll down to the PR checks to find a link to the deployed Storybook.

![PR check for deployed PR](/design-systems-for-developers/avatarlist-github-pr-checks-chromatic-changes.png)

Find the `AvatarList` in your published Storybook. It should look identical to your local Storybook.

![AvatarList in Storybook online](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-deployed-avatarlist-stories-7-0.png)

The published Storybook is a universal reference point for the team. Share the link to `AvatarList` with other stakeholders to get feedback faster. Your team will love you because they don’t have to deal with code or set up a development environment.

![Looks good, ship it!](/design-systems-for-developers/visual-review-shipit.png)

Reaching consensus with numerous teams often feels like an exercise in futility. Folks reference out-of-date code, don’t have a development environment or scatter feedback across multiple tools. Reviewing Storybook online makes it as simple as sharing a URL.

## Test

Our test suite runs in the background every commit. `AvatarList` is a simple presentational component, so unit tests aren’t necessary. But if we look at the PR check, our visual testing tool Chromatic has already detected changes that need reviewing.

![Chromatic changes on the GitHub PR check](/design-systems-for-developers/avatarlist-github-pr-checks-chromatic-changes.png)

Since AvatarList is new, there aren’t visual tests for it yet. We’ll need to add baselines for each story. Accept the “new stories” in Chromatic to expand visual test coverage.

![Chromatic changes to the AvatarList stories](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-avatarlist-changes.png)

Once you’re done, the build will pass in Chromatic.

![Chromatic changes to the AvatarList stories accepted](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-avatarlist-changes-accepted.png)

Which, in turn, updates the PR check in GitHub.

![Chromatic changes accepted on the GitHub PR check](/design-systems-for-developers/avatarlist-github-pr-checks-chromatic-changes-accepted.png)

The tests were successfully updated. In the future, regressions will have a tough time sneaking into the design system.

## Distribute

We have an open pull request that adds `AvatarList` to the design system. We've written our stories, the tests pass, and documentation exists. At last, we’re ready to update our design system package with Auto and npm.

Add the `minor` label to the PR. This tells Auto to update the minor version of the package on merge.

![GitHub PR with labels](/design-systems-for-developers/github-pr-labelled.png)

Now merge your PR, navigate to your package on npm, and hang tight for a few minutes while the package is updated.

![Package published on npm](/design-systems-for-developers/npm-published-package-minor.png)

Success! Your design system package was updated from the comfort of GitHub. No need to touch the command line or fuss with npm. Update the `learnstorybook-design-system` dependency in the example app to start using AvatarList.
