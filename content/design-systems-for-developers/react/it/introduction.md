I design systems stanno conoscendo un crescente aumento di popolarit√†. Dalle grandi realt√† tecnologiche come Airbnb alle agili startup, organizzazioni di ogni tipo stanno riutilizzando modelli UI per risparmiare tempo e denaro.

Tuttavia, esiste un divario tra i design systems creati da BBC, Airbnb, IBM o Microsoft e quelli creati dalla maggior parte degli sviluppatori.

Perch√® i teams leader di design system si avvalgono degli strumenti e delle tecniche che utilizzano?
Il mio coautore Tom ed io abbiamo condotto una ricerca sui tratti di successo dei design system presenti nella community di Storybook al fine di identificare quelle che sono le pratiche migliori.

Questa guida passo-passo intende rivelare l'automazione degli strumenti e i flussi di lavoro utilizzati nei design system di produzione su larga scala.
Percorreremo l'assemblaggio di un design system partendo da librerie di componenti esistenti, per poi configurare i servizi principali, le librerie e i flussi di lavoro.

## In ogni caso, qual √® il problema dei design systems?

Let‚Äôs get something out of the way: the concept of a reusable user interface isn‚Äôt new. Styleguides, UI kits, and shareable widgets have existed for decades. Today, designers and developers are aligning towards the UI component construct. A UI component encapsulates the visual and functional properties of discrete user interface pieces. Think LEGO bricks.

Modern user interfaces are assembled from hundreds of modular UI components that are rearranged to deliver different user experiences.

Design systems contain reusable UI components that help teams build complex, durable, and accessible user interfaces across projects. Since both designers and developers contribute to the UI components, the design system serves as a bridge between disciplines. It is also the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for an organization‚Äôs common components.

Designers often talk about building design systems inside their tools. The holistic scope of a design system encompasses assets (Sketch, Figma, etc.), overarching design principles, contribution structure, governance, and more. There‚Äôs an abundance of designer-oriented guides that dive deep into these topics so we won‚Äôt rehash that here.

For developers, a few things are certain. Production design systems must include the UI components and the frontend infrastructure behind it all. There are three technical parts to a design system that we‚Äôll talk about in this guide:

- üèó Common reusable UI components
- üé® Design tokens: Styling-specific variables such as brand colors and spacing
- üìï Documentation site: Usage instructions, narrative, do‚Äôs and don'ts

The parts are packaged up, versioned, and distributed to consumer apps via a package manager.

## Hai bisogno di un design system?

Despite the hype, a design system isn‚Äôt a silver bullet. If you work with a modest team on a single app, you‚Äôre better off with a directory of UI components instead of setting up the infrastructure to enable a design system. For small projects, the cost of maintenance, integration, and tooling far outweighs any productivity benefits you might see.

The economy of scale in a design system works in your favor when sharing UI components across many projects. If you find yourself pasting the same UI components in different apps or across teams, this guide is for you.

## Cosa stiamo costruendo

Storybook powers the design systems for [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/storybook/index.html?path=/story/style-guide--colours), [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/lunar), [IBM](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/), [GitHub](https://primer.style/css/), and hundreds more companies. The recommendations here are inspired by best practices and tools from the smartest teams. We‚Äôll be building the following frontend stack:

#### Costruire i componenti

- üìö [Storybook](http://storybook.js.org) for UI component development and auto-generated docs
- ‚öõÔ∏è [React](https://reactjs.org/) for declarative component-centric UI (via create-react-app)
- üíÖ [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for component-scoped styling
- ‚ú® [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automatic code formatting

#### Mantenere il sistema

- üö• [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous integration
- üìê [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript linting
- ‚úÖ [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=storybook) to catch visual bugs in components (by Storybook maintainers)
- üì¶ [npm](https://npmjs.com) for distributing the library
- üõ† [Auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto) for release management workflow

#### Componenti aggiuntivi di Storybook

- ‚ôø [Accessibility](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/a11y) to check for accessibility issues during development
- üí• [Actions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/actions) to QA click and tap interactions
- üéõ [Controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls) to interactively adjust props to experiment with components
- üìï [Docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction) for automatic documentation generation from stories
- üîç [Interactions](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-interactions/) for debugging component interactions
- üèé [Test-runner](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner) for automated component testing

## Comprendere il flusso di lavoro

Design systems are an investment in frontend infrastructure. In addition to showcasing how to use the technology above, this guide also focuses on core workflows that promote adoption and simplify maintenance. Wherever possible, manual tasks will be automated. Below are the activities we‚Äôll encounter.

#### Creare componenti UI in maniera isolata

Every design system is composed of UI components. We‚Äôll use Storybook as a ‚Äúworkbench‚Äù to build UI components in isolation outside of our consumer apps. Then we‚Äôll integrate timesaving addons that help you increase component durability (Actions, A11y, Controls, Interactions).

#### Revisionare per raggiungere il consenso e raccogliere feedback

UI development is a team sport that requires alignment between developers, designers, and other disciplines. We‚Äôll publish work-in-progress UI components to loop stakeholders into the development process so we can ship faster.

#### Testare per prevenire bugs a livello UI

Design systems are a single source of truth and a single point of failure. Minor UI bugs in basic components can snowball into company-wide incidents. We‚Äôll automate tests to help you mitigate the inevitable bugs to ship durable, accessible UI components with confidence.

#### Documentare per accelerare l'adozione

Documentation is essential, but creating it is often a developer‚Äôs last priority. We‚Äôll make it much easier for you to document UI components by auto-generating minimum viable docs which can be further customized.

#### Distribuire il design system ai progetti dei consumatori

Once you have well-documented UI components, you need to distribute them to other teams. We‚Äôll cover packaging, publishing, and how to surface the design system in other Storybooks.

## Storybook Design System

This guide‚Äôs example design system was inspired by Storybook‚Äôs own [production design system](https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system). It is consumed by three sites and touched by tens of thousands of developers in the Storybook ecosystem.

In the next chapter, we‚Äôll show you how to extract a design system from disparate component libraries.
